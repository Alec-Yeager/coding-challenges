Things I've learned:

My autoformatter is conform, which routes to prettier.
The config for it is .clang-format and has decent docs. LLVM is nice.
using cmake is necessary for getting the right c++ version. Set the cmake up, and make sure to have:
set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON) 
in there, so that the compile_commands.json gets made, placed in the build folder.
You can have defines by running stuff like 'cmake --DTARGET=12' to set a variable called TARGET.

c++20 has this thing called spans, which can be constructed from the v.begin(), v.end() or any other it pointer set. Kinda nice.
span<vecT> vecSpan(vec.begin() + 1, vec.end())
for example is like vecSpan = vec[2:] in python.

stringstream is really nice.

    stringstream ss(s);
    string word;
    vector<string> words;

    while (ss >> word) {
        words.push_back(word);
    }

you can just construct it from a string and it'll delete spaces for you like this. you can also feed it into ints, which is dope.
seems to be faster in general to use standard iterators than the fancy shit.

just take the fucking normal solution. Don't try hyper optimizing. Wastes time on edge cases sometimes if it's not obvious.
