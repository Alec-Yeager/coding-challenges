Things I've learned:

My autoformatter is conform, which routes to prettier.
The config for it is .clang-format and has decent docs. LLVM is nice.
using cmake is necessary for getting the right c++ version. Set the cmake up, and make sure to have:
set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON) 
in there, so that the compile_commands.json gets made, placed in the build folder.
You can have defines by running stuff like 'cmake --DTARGET=12' to set a variable called TARGET.

c++20 has this thing called spans, which can be constructed from the v.begin(), v.end() or any other it pointer set. Kinda nice.
span<vecT> vecSpan(vec.begin() + 1, vec.end())
for example is like vecSpan = vec[2:] in python.
